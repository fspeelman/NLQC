# Additive Haar measures and continuous linear equivalences

A continuous linear equivalence between finite-dimensional real normed spaces is nonsingular for
any additive Haar measures chosen on its source and target: null sets correspond to null sets
under it, whatever the normalizations. This is uniqueness of additive Haar measure, in the form
`MeasureTheory.Measure.absolutelyContinuous_isAddHaarMeasure`, applied to the pushforward measure,
which is again an additive Haar measure.

## Main results

* `ContinuousLinearEquiv.quasiMeasurePreserving_addHaar`: a continuous linear equivalence
  is quasi measure preserving for additive Haar measures on its source and target.
