# Locally null images

This file provides a local-to-global criterion for the image of a set to have measure zero.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.measure_image_null_of_locally_null`: an image is null as soon as it is locally null.

/-- If every point of `s` has a neighbourhood within `s` whose image under `f` is null, then the
image of `s` is null. A countable subcover, available because the source is second countable,
reduces the global statement to the local ones; this is the image version of
`MeasureTheory.measure_null_of_locally_null`. -/
