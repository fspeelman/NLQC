# Surjective continuous linear maps onto a finite-dimensional space

Surjectivity onto a finite-dimensional space is stable under small perturbations in the operator
norm: the surjective maps form an open subset of the space of continuous linear maps. The source
is an arbitrary normed space over a complete nontrivially normed field.

Mathlib records the companion fact that a surjective continuous linear map between Banach spaces
is an open map, in `ContinuousLinearMap.isOpenMap`; the openness proved here is openness of the
locus of such maps inside `E →L[𝕜] F`, not of any one of them.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isOpen_setOf_surjective`: surjectivity onto a finite-dimensional space is an open
  condition on continuous linear maps.

/-- Surjectivity onto a finite-dimensional space is an open condition on continuous linear maps.

A surjection `A` onto a finite-dimensional space admits a continuous linear right inverse `R`, and
then `B ∘ R` is within distance `‖B - A‖ * ‖R‖` of the identity, hence injective and so, the
target being finite-dimensional, surjective as soon as `B` is close enough to `A`. -/
