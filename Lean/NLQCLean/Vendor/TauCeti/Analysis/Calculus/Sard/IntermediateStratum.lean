# The intermediate strata in Sard's theorem

This file supplies the local dimension-reduction step for the intermediate strata in the
Morse--Sard proof. Suppose the `i`th iterated derivative of a smooth map vanishes at `a`, but the
derivative of order `i + 1` does not. A scalar component of the `i`th derivative then has a nonzero
differential at `a`. Its zero set is a regular hypersurface containing every nearby point where
the `i`th derivative vanishes.

`TauCeti.exists_parametrization_iteratedFDeriv_eq_zero` makes this reduction explicit. It gives a
`C^r` parametrization `θ` from the kernel of a nonzero scalar functional, whose dimension is one
less than that of the source. Locally, the zero set of the `i`th derivative is contained in the
image under `θ` of any prescribed neighbourhood of the origin, and `θ` itself lies in a regular
scalar level set containing that zero set. This is the induction-on-source-dimension input for
proving that the images of the intermediate strata `Σ_i \ Σ_{i+1}` are null.

The scalar component is obtained by Hahn--Banach from a nonzero value of the derivative of
`iteratedFDeriv ℝ i f`. The parametrization is Mathlib's implicit function for that scalar
component. This is the second stratification step following the flat-stratum estimate in
`TauCeti.Analysis.Calculus.Sard.FlatStratum`.

## Main result

* `TauCeti.exists_parametrization_iteratedFDeriv_eq_zero`: near a point of
  `Σ_i \ Σ_{i+1}`, the set `Σ_i` is contained in the image of a `C^r` map from a
  codimension-one space.

/-- **Local hypersurface reduction for an intermediate Sard stratum.** Suppose `f` is `C^{r+i}`
at `a`, with `r > 0`, its `i`th iterated derivative vanishes at `a`, and its `(i+1)`st derivative
does not. Then there are a scalar component `g` of the `i`th derivative, its nonzero derivative
`g'`, and a `C^r` parametrization `θ` from `ker g'` such that:

* every zero of `iteratedFDeriv ℝ i f` is a zero of `g`;
* locally at `a`, every zero of `iteratedFDeriv ℝ i f` lies in the image under `θ` of any
  prescribed neighbourhood of the origin;
* locally at the origin, `θ` lies in the regular level set `g = 0`; and
* `ker g'` has dimension one less than `E`.

In particular, the intermediate stratum where all derivatives through order `i` vanish but the
next does not is locally carried by a smooth map from a strictly lower-dimensional source. -/
