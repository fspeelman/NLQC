# Sard's theorem on the locus where the derivative vanishes

This file proves that a sufficiently smooth map between finite-dimensional real normed spaces
sends the set of points at which its Fréchet derivative vanishes to a set of additive Haar measure
zero, with no relation required between the two dimensions beyond a nontrivial target. Since a
linear map onto a one-dimensional space is surjective exactly when it is nonzero, this is the full
Morse--Sard theorem whenever the target is one-dimensional: the critical values of a smooth
real-valued function on a finite-dimensional real normed space form a null set, and its regular
values are dense.

The proof is Morse's stratification argument, run by induction on the dimension of the source and
assembling the two estimates already available. Write `Σ_i` for the set of points at which the
iterated derivatives of order `1 ≤ j ≤ i` all vanish, and stratify `Σ_1` as
`Σ_1 = Σ_K ∪ ⋃_{i < K} (Σ_i \ Σ_{i+1})` for a depth `K` large enough that
`finrank ℝ E < (K + 1) * finrank ℝ F`.

* On the innermost stratum `Σ_K`, `TauCeti.addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_iteratedFDeriv_eq_zero`
  applies directly: enough derivatives vanish for the Hölder estimate to force nullity.
* Near a point of `Σ_i \ Σ_{i+1}`,
  `TauCeti.exists_parametrization_iteratedFDeriv_eq_zero` carries `Σ_i` by a `C^r` map `θ` out of
  a space of dimension `finrank ℝ E - 1`. Every point of `Σ_1` in the image is a point where
  `f ∘ θ` has vanishing derivative, by the chain rule, so the inductive hypothesis in dimension
  `finrank ℝ E - 1` applies to `f ∘ θ` and returns the local nullity of the image.

Both steps are local, and second countability of the source turns local nullity into global
nullity through `TauCeti.measure_image_null_of_locally_null`.

Each descent step costs derivatives, since the parametrization `θ` is only as smooth as the
implicit function theorem makes it; the regularity `finrank ℝ E * finrank ℝ E + 1` recorded below
is a convenient sufficient bound rather than the sharp one. Morse--Sard holds already for `C^k`
maps with `k ≥ max 1 (finrank ℝ E - finrank ℝ F + 1)`; recovering that sharp exponent needs a
more careful induction than the one run here, and smooth maps satisfy every bound in sight.

The remaining stratum of the general Morse--Sard theorem, the set of critical points at which the
derivative is nonzero but not surjective, is handled by a Fubini argument on a local fibration of
the source in `TauCeti.Analysis.Calculus.Sard.OutermostStratum`, where the theorem itself is
assembled; the results here are what that argument runs its induction against.

This is Lane F0 of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap, where finite-dimensional Sard is the
prerequisite for Sard--Smale and hence for every transversality argument downstream.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_fderiv_eq_zero`: the image of a set of points at which the
  derivative vanishes is null, for a map that is `C^k` at those points with `k` large enough.
* `TauCeti.ContDiff.addHaar_image_vanishingFDeriv_eq_zero`: its global form for a smooth map.
* `TauCeti.setOf_not_surjective_fderiv_eq_setOf_fderiv_eq_zero_of_finrank_eq_one`: for a
  one-dimensional target, the critical locus is exactly the vanishing-derivative locus.

/-- **Sard's theorem on the locus where the derivative vanishes.** Let `f` be a map between
finite-dimensional real normed spaces with nontrivial target, and let `s` be a set at each point
of which `f` is `C^n` and the Fréchet derivative of `f` vanishes. If
`((finrank ℝ E * finrank ℝ E + 1 : ℕ) : ℕ∞ω) ≤ n`, then `f '' s` has additive Haar measure zero.

No relation between the two dimensions is required, beyond a nontrivial (positive-dimensional)
target: the vanishing of the derivative, rather than a dimension count, is what the higher
derivatives are used against. The smoothness bound is sufficient, not the sharp exponent of the
Morse--Sard theorem. -/
